# GUI-DIT102

The **Blackmarket Firearm Management System** is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to manage a list of firearms by adding, updating, searching, and deleting firearms from the system. The data is stored in a CSV file, and the application dynamically updates the total count of firearms.
